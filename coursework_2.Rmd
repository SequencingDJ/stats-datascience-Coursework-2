```{r}
library("readr")

```{r}
install.packages("bio3d", dependencies=TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(bio3d)

```{r}
library("readr")
df <- readr::read_csv2("pkas.csv")
head(df)
```
```{r}
summary(df)
df[6000000,]
```

There are 12,628,148 sequences!
It would be required to obtain the sequences of each, alongside their pKa values.

```{r}
colnames(df)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
newdf <- df %>%
  filter(idcode == "3epp")

newdf
```
```{r}
uniqueid <- unique(df$idcode)
length(uniqueid)
```

121294 total unique proteins

Sequences
---------------------------------------------

```{r}
testset <- uniqueid[1:10]
# data I want to put into PDBe API as a test.
# argument sake, we will take 10 ids first
testset


```


```{r}
writeLines(testset)
```

I somehow want to get the testset sequences from PDB, remember to append their chain and residue number?
